				READ10XBSYS


NAME
	read10xbsys - read a tape produced by the TENEX BSYS program

SYNOPSIS
	read10xbsys [-s] [-r] directory file.name

	Use -r when you want the tape to automatically rewind at the end
	of every retrieval.  Note that this greatly increases the time
	when retrieving consecutive files.

	If one argument is provided, it is assumed that it's the directory
	name, and the program proceeds to recover all the files from that
	directory.  

DESCRIPTION
	Read10xbsys reads tapes produced by the TENEX BSYS archival program, 
	producing the directory listings and optionally extracting files.

	
TO PRODUCE A TAPE DIRECTORY LISTING
	Run read10xbsys without any arguments.
	The listing will be in the format:

	<wiederhold>ucode.optimizer
	<system>bsysdoc
	etc.

	The string in <> is the name of the directory in which the file
	was in TENEX.  
	
	The program will stop when it reaches the end of the tape.

TO RETRIEVE A FILE
	The users have a file in their unix directories listing all the
	files they archived on TENEX.  The file is named user.10xdir where
	user stands for the name the user had on TENEX.
	As an example of what the file looks  like, here is an excerpt from the
	file wiederhold.10xdir:

	SAVED.MESSAGES;8212	942	9-Jan-83	943	10-Jan-83
	BIBLIO.COMBINED;2	939	4-Jan-83	940	4-Jan-83
	UNIX.LOCKS;1		931	18-Dec-82	932	18-Dec-82
	PRINT.FALL82;1		931	18-Dec-82	932	18-Dec-82

	The users will most likely just send excerpts from this file when
	requesting a file to be retrieved.  The pertinent information from
	these excerpts is as follows:
	The name of the TENEX directory (<WIEDERHOLD> in this example)
	The name of the file (UNIX.LOCKS in this example)
	The tape on which the file is located (931 or 932 in this example)

	To retrieve the file <WIEDERHOLD>UNIX.LOCKS, first mount either
	tape 931 or 932.
	Then, run the program:
		read10xbsys wiederhold unix.locks
	where the name of the directory is the first argument, and the name
	of the file the second argument.

	Note that the names of files and directories will be capitalized in
	the retrieval request, but to retrieve the file, you should not use
	capital letters.

	Also note that the directory of the tape will still be printed on
	the screen up until and including the file to be extracted.

	The retrieved file will be put in the directory you are currently in,
	and will have the same name it had in TENEX except it will not be
	in capital letters (unix.locks in this example).

	If two files with the same name need to be retrieved, the second file
	will overwrite the first file.  Therefore, the operator is advised
	to rename the first file before running the second retrieval.

	The read10xbsys program stops as soon as it has retrieved the requested
	file, and does not rewind the tape.  Therefore, consecutive files
	can be easily restored (see description below).

	RETRIEVING FILES WITH NO EXTENSION/STRANGE CHARACTERS IN THE NAME
	
	Some files will not have an extension, ex: <WIEDERHOLD>FOO

	To retrieve this file, run the program:
		read10xbsys wiederhold foo
	
	If there is a unix-reserved character in the file name, such as !, 
	use \ to retrieve the file.
	
	ex: <WIEDERHOLD>F!.32

	would be retrieved with the command:
		read10xbsys wiederhold f\!.32

	RETRIEVING CONSECUTIVE FILES

	In the file user.10xdir, the archived files are listed in the reverse
	order in which they were archived.  Therefore, when there is a request
	to retrieve more than one file from the same tape, here is a time-saving
	procedure.  Simply retrieve the files in the reverse order than they
	are listed in the user.10xdir file.  

	Example:

	The following two files are on the same tapes, and are listed in
	the file wiederhold.10xdir in the following order:

	UNIX.LOCKS;1		931	18-Dec-82	932	18-Dec-82
	PRINT.FALL82;1		931	18-Dec-82	932	18-Dec-82

	However, on the tape, the file print.fall82 comes before the file 
	unix.locks.  Therefore, one should first retrieve print.fall82, 
	and then the unix.locks file.

	STOPPING/CONTINUING

	If for some reason, the read10xbsys program is interrupted, and then
	needs to be continued without rewinding the tape, it is imperative
	to use the -s.

	In other words, if a retrieval had been started with the command
		read10xbsys foo bar.la
	and then interrupted with ctrl-c, the retrieval should be continued
	with the command
		read10xbsys -s foo bar.la

	It is not necessary to use the -s if the tape is rewound after the
	interruption.

	RETRIEVING ALL FILES FROM A DIRECTORY

	To retrieve all files which belong to a certain user/directory,
	just give one argument to the program: the name of the directory.
	It will look through the whole tape for all such files, so it is
	recommended that you use the -r flag for automatic rewinding of the
	tape.

	The files will get saved in the current directory.
	Note the danger: if there are several files on the tape which all
	have the same name, the file will keep being overwritten and in the
	end, you will only have retrieved the last file on tape with that name.


	REWINDING THE TAPE

	The command echo < /dev/rmt8 will rewind the tape.
